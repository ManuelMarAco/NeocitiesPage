                    <h2>Nora, me, this Queer Disaster</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm <span class="resaltado">Nora</span> (they/them). I'm a <span class="resaltado">Spanish student</span> in a <span class="resaltado">web development</span> course. This website has nothing to do with that course, but since I learn't how to write html I though I should put it to use.</p>
                    <p>I've identified as <span class="resaltado">AroAce</span> since 2020 and as <span class="resaltado">Non-Binary</span> since summer of 2022 (I started to use <span class="resaltado">Genderqueer</span> recently too). I consider myself <span class="resaltado">transfem</span>, but in a weird way. I try to <span class="resaltado"></span>educate about social issues (LGBTQ+, race, feminism, class oppression, etc) everytime I get the chance, so you may see some zines around here.</p>
                    <p>I'm pretty sure I have <span class="resaltado">AuDHD</span>, although I'm not seeking a proper diagnosis. I try not to be overbearing with my interests, but you'll be able to find them in some <span class="resaltado">blog</span> entries (probably).</p>
                    <p>I love many <span class="resaltado">aesthetics</span>, but I mainly stay between goth, punk and metal. This site is mainly <span class="resaltado">punk</span> looking, but you could see it change.</p>
                    <p>I've designed a few <span class="resaltado">TTRPG</span> systems and adventures in the past, but I haven't published almost any of it. Maybe I'll share something through here in the future.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, a bit of <span class="resaltado">trivia</span>, my favourite colour is purple, my favourite animal is the possum and my MBTI is ENFP.</p>
